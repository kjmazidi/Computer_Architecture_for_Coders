# Computer Architecture for Coders
## Chapter 5: Control Structures

* ifelse1.asm - if-else example
* loop1.asm - example of a for or while loop
* function_leaf.asm - simple function example
* function_non_leaf1.asm - leaf and non-leaf function
* fact_iter.asm - factorial program, iterative version
* fact_recursive.asm - factorial program, recursive version
* loop-point.asm - loop through an array using a pointer paradigm
* loop-arr.asm - loop through an array using an array index paradigm
* str1.asm - loop through a string of characters, replacing the newline with \0 null terminator; This program's code contains a flaw that is fixed in str2.asm
* str2.asm - same as str1.asm but sets a limit on how far the progrm will go through memory in its search for a newline to replace
* folder practice_problems - some coding set-ups to help you practice control structures in MIPS
* folder practice_problems_solutions - sample solutions to the above
